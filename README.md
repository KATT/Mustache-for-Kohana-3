# Mustache for Kohana 3 - v0.1

`Mustache for Kohana 3` is a simple wrapper to easily implement Mustache within your Kohana 3 project. It is dependent on the Mustache class by Justin Hileman <http://defunkt.github.com/mustache>. This class is also included in this module, as it has been enhanced a bit.

### How to use

1. Add `classes` to a folder of your choice in your `modules` folder
2. Use `MustacheView::factory` or `new MustacheView` like the default `View` class

You bet, no 3rd step!
